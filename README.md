### Description
Zeal adds quality of life functionality to the legacy (2002) Everquest client
used by most TAKP EqEMU players. The Miles Sound System used by that client
supports plug-ins for arbitrary audio filtering, and Zeal injects itself into the
client like a standard dll by using the .asi extension in the EQ root directory.
It can then patch itself into the client's processing loop and callbacks to
add new functionality and smooth out issues in the old client.

Zeal custom code is entirely open source and the releases are built directly
from the repo using github actions, providing full transparency on the contents.

### Features
- Camera motion improvements (major improvements to third person view)
- Additional key binds (tab targeting, corpse cycling, strafe, pet, map,
  autoinventory, autofire, buy/sell stacks)
- Additional commands (melody, autofire, useitem, autoinventory, autobank,
  link all, loot all, raid survey, singleclick, show loot lockouts, etc)
- Integrated map (see In-game Map section below)
- Additional ui support (new gauges, bag control & locking, looting, spellsets, targetrings,
  nameplates, right click to equip, skill window sorting, etc)
- Autostand on move/cast, autosit on camp with export inventory/spellbook option
- Enhanced chat (% replacements, additional filters and colors, tell windows,
  tab completion, copy and paste)
- Notification sounds (tells, group invites)
- Third party tool support (silent log messages, direct ZealPipes)
- Various client bug fixes and patches (crashe fixes, helm graphical glitches, etc)

### Installation
#### The easy way
1. [Download](https://github.com/iamclint/Zeal/releases/latest) the latest official (non-beta) Zeal
   - Scroll down past the list of changes to the `Assets` section and download the `zeal_v#.#.#_*.zip` file
   - Ignore the `Source code` files
2. Quit Everquest and extract the zip file contents into your EQ game root directory
   - Key required files are the `zeal.asi` and the `uifiles/zeal` folder
   - If you have previously installed zeal, deleting the old `uifiles/zeal` is recommended before copying over
3. Recommended: Install a UI skin modified with the extra Zeal UI functionality
   such as mana gauges, experience per hour, loot all / link buttons, etc.
   - If the UI is not updated, there will be some XML error complaints that can be ignored
   - Check the list below, the Quarm discord `#ui-discussion` channel, or the Quarm guide
    link below for compatible UI's
4. Test Zeal installation in game by typing "/zeal version" and "/help zeal".
5. Configure Zeal using the new Zeal options window and assign new key binds.
   - The Zeal options window opens in parallel to the EQ options window (Alt-o)

#### If that doesn't work
Ensure that sound is enabled in the game (the volume level can be set to zero).
   - Check that `Sound=TRUE` in the `eqclient.ini` in your root Everquest directory

A comprehensive guide, including troubleshooting, can be found at
https://quarm.guide/install-guides under "Installing Zeal" or a
simplified checklist under "Checklist for Installing Zeal".

Note that the method Zeal uses to inject itself into the client can trigger the
heuristics of anti-virus scanners to label it as malware. See trouble-shooting
guide above if your `Zeal.asi` file keeps disappearing.

#### Description of zip file contents
1. `Zeal_README.md`: A copy of this readme file
2. `Zeal.asi`: Executable code that is loaded when EQ sound is enabled
3. `Zeal.pdb`: Symbol debug file for the `zeal.asi`. Developer use only.
4. `uifiles/zeal`: Folder with Zeal specific UI modifications (options, new features)
   - The files in `uifiles/zeal` override `uifiles/default` and `uifiles/<your_skin>`
5. `crashes/`: Folder with optional crash reporter that will send any captured crash zip logs for review 

#### Storage location of Zeal settings (in eqgame.exe folder)
1. `zeal.ini`: Contains most of the zeal settings (some common, some per character)
2. `eqclient.ini`: Contains extended key binds
3. `UI_<name>_pq.ini`: Configuration of Zeal client windows (map, extra item display, options)
4. `<name>_spellsets.ini`: Per character saved spell sets
5. `<name>_protected.ini`: Per character saved /protect item list

## Polling of raid using /survey
### Usage by Zeal-enabled raidmembers:
#### Configuration:
- All raid members should execute `/survey on` to enable (persistent setting only needed once)
  - When on, Zeal monitors for the special survey message to enable auto channel joining & auto
    opening of the dialog box as well as accumulate poll results.
- The originator of questions needs to specify the response chat channel using `/survey channel <name>`
  - The `<name>` must start with a `survey` prefix (e.g., `/survey channel survey123`)
  - The channel name is also persistent and only needs to be set once
  - Use a unique suffix to avoid response collisions with other /survey parties
  
#### Polling:
`/survey new <question>` starts a new survey.
  - This generates a raidsay message `ZEAL_SURVEY | <channel> | <question>` that is detected by
    Zeal when in the raid
  - If /survey is enabled, Zeal will join the chat channel to send the response
  - Zeal then opens a dialog box for raid members to respond and sends the answer to the chat channel
    as `ZEAL_RESPONSE | <answer>`
    - Answers besides yes/no from the dialog can be sent with `/survey response <answer>`
  - Zeal monitors the survey chat channel and accumulates the responses (and snuffs all messages)

`/survey results` will print the results of the poll to local chat
  - Counts up each unique response with a list of first 25 names
  - Also reports a count and list of up to 25 raid members who didn't respond

`/survey share` prints the summary results (no names) to /raidsay

### Usage by non-Zeal raidmembers
In order to participate, they can manually watch for the ZEAL_SURVEY raid messages and then
manually join the chat channel and send their response by sending a message to the channel:
`/# ZEAL_RESPONSE | <answer>` where # is the chat channel. Zeal users can share the tallied results.
Note that the joined response chat channel will not be filtered by Zeal so it will get spammy.
They could leave after submitting their response to avoid it.

Zeal uses 'spritefont' files generated by MakeSprintFont.exe, a Microsoft windows command line tool.
  - https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTK/wiki/MakeSpriteFont
  - Click on Downloads@Latest
  - Example command line:
   `./MakeSpriteFont "Arial" /FontStyle:Bold /FontSize:30 /TextureFormat:CompressedMono arial_bold_30.spritefont`
  - Copy the new fonts to the `uifiles/zeal/fonts` folder
  - It will now be selectable from the combobox in game next time the options window is opened
  - Note: You will need to manually back up these fonts when updating Zeal if erasing the uifiles folder

---

Zeal includes options for players to adjust Player Nameplates and NPC Nameplates in game.
In addition, Skeletons now show a Nameplate. (Client Skeleton Nameplate Bug Fix)
Necromancers will now have an easier time finding their corpses.

The nameplate is controlled through three interfaces:
* Dedicated Zeal options window tab (requires `zeal\uifiles`, see Installation notes above)
* Key binds for nameplate options (configure in EQ Options->Keyboard->Target)
* The /nameplate commands described below

#### Enabling Disabling Nameplate Options

The following 19 Nameplate Colors can be changed to custom colors.
* AFK, LFG, LD, MyGuild, Raid, Group, PVP, Roleplay, OtherGuilds, DefaultAdventurer

#### Zeal Nameplate Font Choices and Drop Shadow option
1. The Zeal Nameplate tab now supports selecting custom "spritefont" formatted bitmap font files
 to choose which font your Zeal Nameplate has. Using this option turns off the normal Nameplate
 and replaces it with the Zeal Nameplate. There will be some variation in the location of the custom
 Zeal nameplate versus the client.
2. The Zeal Nameplate tab now offers a Drop Shadow option when using custom fonts for Nameplates.
  This option makes the font more visible by adding a black shadow behind the text.

A few sizes of arial font and arial_bold font are included with Zeal install and accessed through the
options tab combobox. See above for notes on how to generate new fonts.

---
### In-game Map
#### Map data source
The map data was sourced from Brewall's maps: https://www.eqmaps.info/eq-map-files/ with minimal
modifications (see README.md in zone_map_src). As a result there are some out of era points of interest.

#### Setup and configuration
Zeal 4.0 and later includes an integrated in-game map that contains the map data for
all zones through Planes of Power. The map is drawn into the game's DirectX viewport
as part of the rendering sequence and is by default not 'clickable' (see interactive mode below).

The map is controlled through four interfaces:
* Dedicated Zeal options window tab (requires `zeal\uifiles`, see Installation notes above)
* Mouse interactions (external window or internal window in interactive mode)
* Key binds for frequent map actions (configure in EQ Options->Keyboard->UI)
* The /map command

Most of the default map settings are stored in the zeal.ini file of the root Everquest directory.
The defaults are updated when adjusting settings in the Zeal options map tab. The size and
position of the internal map window is stored as part of the UI_character.ini files like normal
game windows. The key binds and /map commands create temporary changes unless the
`/map save_ini` command is used.

It is recommended to use the Options tab to adjust the basic map settings to the preferred
defaults (background, labels, names, marker sizes) and then use the keybinds for more
frequent map adjustments (on/off, toggle zoom, toggle backgrounds, toggle labels,
toggle visible levels).  The /map commands include extra options like poi search.

#### Enabling the map
* Zeal options checkbox
* Key bind: "Toggle Map" - Toggles map on and off (recommend 'm')
* Command examples:
  - `/map` - Toggles map on and off
  - `/map on` - Turns map on
  - `/map off` - Turns map off

#### Map size, position, and alignment
The external map window (see external map window below) can be moved and resized like a standard window.

The internal map operates in two modes.  In interactive mode, the map is framed by a
standard client window that allows it to be positioned and sized. When disabled, the
map draw viewport is fixed and transparent to the mouse. See Interactive Mode below
for more details.

The internal map size and position can also be controlled by the `/map size` command.
The content is drawn to fit within a rectangular viewport defined by a top left corner,
a height, and a width specified as a percentage of the game window dimensions. The
map viewport is relative to the game window and independent of the game /viewport,
so the map can be placed anywhere in the game window.

The zones have different aspect ratios, so some zones will scale to fill the height
and others the width.  The map alignment setting (top left, top center, top right)
controls where the map is drawn when it is height constrained.

* Zeal option enables for interactive mode or external window and a combobox for alignment
* Command examples:
  - `/map size 2 3 50 60` map window top=2% left=3% height=50% width=60% of game window dimensions
  - `/map alignment center` aligns the aspect ratio constrained map to the top center of the viewport

#### Map background
The map supports four different options for the map background for contrast enhancement:
clear (0), dark (1), light (2), or tan (3).  Additionally, it supports alpha transparency.

* Zeal options combo box for map background and slider for setting alpha as a percent
* Key bind: "Toggle Map Background" - toggles through the four settings
* Command examples:
  - `/map background 1` sets the background to dark with no change to alpha
  - `/map background 2 40` sets the background to light with 40% alpha

#### External map window
The map has simple support for opening an external window outside of the EQ client window.
This window can be moved and resized like a standard window. See interactive mode for other 
mouse inputs. The map content is controlled with the normal map key binds. Use the save_ini
command to store the current size and position as the default.

* Zeal options checkbox
* Command examples:
  - `/map external` - Toggles map between internal overlay and external window
  - `/map save_ini` - Stores the current external window size and position (and other settings)

If the map content looks pixelated, the monitor may be set to a DPI scaling greater than 100%.
Note that the EQ application itself does not properly handle this. To workaround, set the 
Windows override to tell the OS that the application will handle scaling:
  * Right click on eqgame.exe:
    - Properties -> Compatibility -> Change high DPI settings -> High DPI scaling override -> By application

#### Map zoom
The default 100% map scale makes the entire zone visible sized to the height or width constraint.
In zoom, the map draws all available data that fits within the rectangular viewport. The zoom
algorithm works to maximize the visible map closest to the player. Map edges will be pinned
to a viewport edge until the user moves at least half the viewport away, and then the map
background will scroll with the player centered in the viewport.

* Zeal options slider and default zoom select combobox
* Key bind: "Toggle Map Zoom" - toggles through 100%, 200%, 400%, 800% zoom
* Command examples:
  - `/map zoom 200` sets map scaling to 200% (2x)

#### Interactive mode
* Note: Use right click context menu in interactive mode to unlock the window to move and resize.

The map supports drag panning and mouse wheel zoom in interactive mode. Interactive mode is always 
enabled in external window mode, while a keybind toggle is used to toggle the internal overlay map
in and out of interactive mode. When not in interactive mode, the internal overlay map is transparent
to the mouse. When interactive mode is enabled, the map can be panned using a left mouse button drag
and zoomed using the scroll wheel. Once panning starts, auto-center is disabled until a right mouse
button click. The external window also supports a middle mouse button click to drop markers.

* Key bind: "Toggle Map Interactive Mode" - toggles internal overlay between transparent and interactive

#### Show zone mode and world data search
Zone maps other than the player's current location can be explored using the show_zone command. The
target zone is specified using the zone's short name (like /who all). Interactive mode, levels, grid,
labels, and poi search all work for the selected zone.

The world command allows browsing the available zone names in EQWorldData. See command examples below.

* Command examples
  - `/map show_zone gukbottom` shows the zone map for the Ruins of Old Guk
  - `/map show_zone` exits show_zone mode
  - `/map world dump` prints the zone ids, short names, and long names of all available zones
  - `/map world search karan` prints all available zones that contain 'karan' in their short or long names

#### Map grid
A simple background grid aligned at a selectable pitch is available. The x == 0 and y == 0 axes
are colored orange.

* Zeal options checkbox (enable) and slider (pitch)
* Command examples:
  - `/map grid` toggles grid on and off
  - `/map grid 500` sets the grid pitch to 500 loc units (lines at multiples of 500)

#### Map ring
A simple distance ring around the current position is available. The distance can be auto-set
based on the tracking skill for rangers, druids, and bards, so they can simply toggle the ring
on and off with `/map ring` (or explicitly on or off with `ring on` or `ring off`).

* Command examples:
  - `/map ring` if visible or a non-tracker, turns ring off
  - `/map ring` if not visible, sets the ring at max tracking distance per skill level
  - `/map ring on` sets the ring at max tracking distance per skill level
  - `/map ring off` turns ring off
  - `/map ring 500` sets the ring around the player at a distance of 500 (all classes)

#### Showing group and raid members
The map supports showing the live position of other group and raid members. The group
member markers are slighly shrunken player position markers and colored in this order
relative to their group listing: red, orange, green, blue, purple. The raid member
markers are simple fixed triangles with varying color.  Since there are a high number
of potential raid members, it is recommended to not use the persistent Show Raid checkbox
in the options tab and instead use the key bind to situationally toggle it on and off.

* Zeal options combobox to select group members mode (off, marker, numbers, names)
* Zeal checkbox to enable raid member visibility
* Zeal slider to adjust name length
* Key bind: "Toggle Map Show Raid" - Toggles visibility of raid members
* Key bind: "Flash Map Member Names" - Toggles (previously flashed) names of group and raid members
* Command examples:
  - `/map show_group` toggles the group member markers on and off
  - `/map show_group labels_off` disables group member labels
  - `/map show_group numbers` enables numeric (F2-F6) group member labels (uses nameplate colors)
  - `/map show_group names` enables shortened group member names (uses nameplate colors)
  - `/map show_group length 8` sets the shortened length of group and raid member names to 8
  - `/map show_raid` toggles the raid member markers on and off

#### Showing map levels
The map supports showing different levels based on the Brewall map color standards. Not all of
the zones are properly colored, but it does work well in some of the 3-D overlapping zones. It
also supports a simplified auto z-level mode that shows map data within a z-level range of the
player as fully opaque and further data at a faded alpha transparency level. The auto-mode
is selectable using the toggle map level keybinds (see below).

* Zeal slider to adjust the faded z-level alpha transparency value
* Key bind: "Toggle Map Level Up", "Toggle Map Level Down" - toggles up or down the visible level
  - The default index of 0 shows all levels and -1 = auto z-level.
* Command examples:
  - `/map level` shows the current zone's map data level info
  - `/map level 0` shows default of all levels
  - `/map level 2` shows the current zone's level 2 data
  - `/map level -1` enables auto z-level mode
  - `/map level autoz 10`  sets the auto z-level mode height limit to +/- 10 (setting to 0 restores default)

#### Position markers
The map supports adding position markers for easier identification of target coordinates. The
markers have a label centered above them, with the default set to the marker loc values. There
is no set limit to the number of markers. See how to clear them below.

* Zeal options slider to adjust the marker size
* Command examples:
  - `/map marker 1100 -500` adds a map marker at /loc of 1100, -500 labeled "(1100, -500)"
  - `/map 1100 -500` is a shortcut for the command above to set a marker at 1100, -500
  - `/map marker -300 200 camp` adds a map marker at /loc of -300, 200 labeled "camp"
  - `/map marker` clears all markers
  - `/map 0` is a shortcut for clearing all markers
  - `/map marker size 40` sets the marker size to "40%"

#### Map font
The map supports selecting a "spritefont" formatted bitmap font file. A few sizes of arial
font are included with Zeal and are located in uifiles/zeal/fonts. See the zeal/bitmap_font.cpp
file for notes on how to generate new fonts. The default font is embedded in the code and can
be selected with the font name `default`.

* Zeal options combobox to select from available fonts
* Command examples:
  - `/map font arial_10` changes the current map font to Arial size 10

#### Map points of interest (poi), labels, and search
The map supports listing the available points of interest and adding them as labels to the map.
Note that some maps have many points of interest, so the all setting for the labels can clutter
up the map even in zoom. The keybind to toggle through the label modes is recommended.

* Zeal options combobox for setting the labels mode (off, summary, all)
* Key bind: "Toggle Map Labels" - toggles through the labels modes
* Command examples:
  - `/map poi` lists the available poi's, including their indices
  - `/map poi 4` adds a marker on index [4] of the `/map poi` list
  - `/map poi butcherblock` performs a text search of the poi list for butcherblock, reports 
     any matches, and adds a marker on the first one
  - `/map butcherblock` shortcut for above (does not work for terms that match other commands)
  - `/map labels summary` enables the summary labels (other options are `off`, `all`, or `marker`)

#### Map data source
The map has simple support for external map data files. The map data_mode can be set to `internal`,
`both`, or `external`. In `both`, the internal maps are combined with any available data from an
external file for that zone. In `external`, the internal map data for the zone is ignored if
external file data exists for that zone. In all cases internal data is used if external data is
not present.

Note that some features, such as level recognition, are not currently supported with external data.

The external map files must be placed in a `map_files` directory in the root everquest directory
with zones named to match their short names (ie `map_files/commons.txt` contains the data for
West Commonlands).  An optional, `_1.txt` file (ie `map_files/commons_1.txt`) will also be
parsed if present, so Brewall map files with POIs can be directly dropped in.

The external map support requires a format compatible with Brewall map data.
```
L x0, y0, z0, x1, y1, z1, red, green, blue
P x, y, z, red, green, blue, ignored, label_string
```

* Zeal options combobox to set data mode
* Command examples:
  - `/map data_mode both` adds external zone map file data if present to internal maps
  - `/map data_mode external` uses external zone map files if present to replace internal maps
