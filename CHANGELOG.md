Summarizes notable changes to Zeal

## [0.6.6] - 2025/04/05

### New features:
*  Character select screen now allows zone selection and explore mode
   - Selected zone becomes the future char select background
   - Adds a dynamic Zeal_ZoneSelect button that will appear if the
     EQUI_CharacterSelect.xml lacks it
   - Custom skins can control the button location and appearance by adding the button
   - The uifiles/zeal/optional has an xml that can be copied to the uifiles/default folder
     to control it in the default screen (which always appears at first startup)
   - Known issues w/explore:
      - Applying a new zone, then exploring, then exiting has issues
      - No jumping and a few other similar UI limitations

* Added options to play sounds upon group invite or a new incoming tell
  - Controlled by combobox Zeal general options.
  - Setting to None disables (default).

* Nameplate enhancements:
  - Added a 'Guild LFG' nameplate color
  - Added a 'PVP Ally' nameplate color (applies to raid, group, and guild members in PVP)

* New [/survey command](https://github.com/iamclint/Zeal?tab=readme-ov-file#polling-of-raid-using-survey) for polling raid group with yes/no questions

* Existing command enhancements:
  - Added `/protect cursor`: toggles protection of cursor item
  - Added `/protect worn`: enables protection of all equipped items
  - Added `/hidecorpse showlast`: unhides the last hidden corpse
  - Added `/hidecorpse npc`: hides all existing NPC corpses (excludes players)

* `/linkall` improvements
  - Now sorted alphabetically
  - Supports displaying more than 10 items
    - Active chat window: Add active links until there are 10
      and then it will just add remaining item as text names
    - `/linkall <channel>`: Split the item links across
      multiple channel messages to stay below the 10 link limit.

* Map
  - Corrected out of area map data for arena (hat tip to Talodar)
  - Added iceclad2 map and default Brewall maps for future zones

* Added weapon (ratio) to item display

* New keybinds:
  - Added a new UI hotkey option (244) that duplicates clicking on the buy or sell button
    with the shift key held down
  - Added a new Keyboard->Chat keybind that will deactivate all visible tell windows.
    Note that if history is enabled, unnoticed messages could be dropped. Sending a new
    tell to the person or /r will pop back up the tell window (with history if enabled).

* Added new gauge type 34 (attack recovery timer)
  - New gauge provides a countdown gauge / string tracking the
    attack (range/melee) recovery countdown

* /outputfile inventory support for expanded bank slots

* Added option checkboxes to enable linking the visibility of the
  target ring or the floating combat damage with the F10 UI
  visibility toggle ("Hide with Gui")
  - Fixed an issue with FCD where the spell icons remained visible
    but the text were hidden with the GUI

* New fps limiter option in Zeal General options

* Added the resurrection dialog message to chat and log to support 
  external triggers

* Changes to boot heap corruption check
  - Made the checks more conservative (multiple check failures required)
  - Added a speculative crit section wrapper
  - Added dialog options to retry and ignore so user can bypass

### Fixes / infrastructure:
  - Fix a possible nullptr crash in singleclick when accessing a world container
  - Removed unused build Visual Studio project build configurations
  - Add better detection of and handling for infinite crash loops
  - Added additional camera view to the enum since character select already uses type 5


## [0.6.5] - 2025/02/27

### New features:
* Additional chat filter and color options for melee specials
  - backstabs, kicks, strikes

* New /run command that controls run versus walk mode
    - /run (toggles), /run on, /run off (walk)

* New zeal general tab option to detect /assist failures
  - Clears current target and emits warning

* New zeal general tab option to suppress fizzles messages from non-grouped casters

* New /uilock command that supports on and off toggling
  of the UI Lock state for primary game windows
  - Bags must be open to take effect

* New /lootlast command that specifies an item ID (either
  by a direct number or using an item link) that will be looted
  last during /lootall of your own corpse (and thus not looted
  since /lootall leaves an item on your own corpse)

* Extended /protect to also cover NPC / pet trades
   - /protect on now blocks all trades to bankers (money, items)
   - Item and non-empty bag protection now applies to trades to NPCs
     and pets (value is not checked)

* New nameplate options to enable mana and stamina bars
  - Self-only for now until server provides more information to client
  - Also added another sample font: segoeui_bold_24

* Map:
  - Added the short and long zone names to the internal and external window title bars
  - Add map option to show raid member headings (versus triangles)

* Added a new spell recast timer option in zeal general tab that adds buff timer-like
  tooltip countdowns for each spell gem
  - Similar text-only information to EqTypes 26-33 above but should not require xml updates
  - Has extra option to left align the timer display instead of default location

* New UI Gauges to support server tick timer and spell cast recovery times (requires XML updates)
  - Added a new gauge (EqType 24) that shows a server synced 6 second timer tick gauge
  - Added a new gauge (EqType 25) that shows the global cooldown (recovery) after casting
  - Added new gauges (EqTypes 26-33) for each spell gem slot that show the recast countdown time

Note: UISkin authors, if you want to hide the gauge text number, make it go offscreen
with something like:
```
<TextOffsetX>-500</TextOffsetX>
<TextOffsetY>-500</TextOffsetY>
```

* Reduced the nameplate drop shadow offset for sharper text
  -  Added a /nameplate shadowfactor <float> to allow users to adjust the offset

* Added a new /singleclick command and linked zeal general option that toggles the
 single click automatic transfer of stacked items to an open give, trade, or crafting
 station container window as unstacked items
  - If ctrl+left click, transfers 1 item from stack over
  - If shift+left click, transfers entire stack
  - To simplify things for now, singleclick is a no-op on nodrop item stacks
  - Note: Singleclick transfers to other players is disabled until more testing
    is done (npcs still work for quests)
  - Singleclick transfer to inventory tradeskill bags requires them to be explicitly
    targeted with a /singleclick bag # command.  This is a non-persistent setting.
    0 disables, bags 1-8. Intended for use only during intensive tradeskilling sessions.

* Support auto-sit and automatic inventory / spell export across all camp pathways
  - The camp button did not support auto-sit or exports.  Binds did not support export.
  - Hook the common camp call so that /camp, keybind, button, and hotkeys all support
    both auto-sit and exports

* ItemDisplay windows updated to report the required level for clickies


## Fixes and infrastructure
* Patches to song window to support the updated eqgame.dll
  - Add Song Window support to ui_buff
  - Added Song Window label range to labels.cpp to avoid future conflicts

* Added instruction cache flushes when modifying code

* Fix: Prevent /sit while in loss of control

* Fix: Designed out potential memory leaks in the CXSTR (client string) handling
  - The refactoring cleanup should make it "harder" to leak in the future,

* Fix: The /log off command has not been working properly since the print_chat
  hook for timestamping was added. Setting /log off will now disable logging.


## [0.6.4] - 2025/02/04

### New features:
Nameplates
* Add custom font supports to the nameplates
  - Controlled through nameplate options tab or /nameplate zealfont to toggle
  - Can use any zeal installed fonts (added more fonts with reasonable sizes)
  - Added drop shadow support, bottom align for centered text
* Enabled the target auto-attack blinking indicator. Synchronized
  it with the targetring and uses the targetring options slider for rate.
  - Added target blink always and only during auto-attack options
* Added option to show pet owner names as second line to nameplate ("Pet" for self-pet)
* Adds an option to display a health bar at the bottom of visible nameplates (custom font only)
  - Due to client data limitations, only applies to self, group, pet, target

* Add option to disable self target ring

Map:
* Added a small dull yellow position marker for self-pet if show group members is enabled
* Added a new options checkbox that enables text with your current location in the upper left corner
* Map supports loading zones not in the linked in database
  - Adds /map world command to lookup zone names

Floating combat damage:
* Added filters for suppressing damage from self, from pets, from other players, and from melee
* Switched to using the HPUpdate packets to report heal events which is mostly functional.
  - Note that self heals effectively bypass this so don't show up
* Added a "big hit" slider to make some damage outputs persist longer and stronger (values above threshold)
* Added FCD specific color settings in the zeal colors tab for controlling the FCD colors

Tab completion:
* Restored native client behavior to flush text beyond /tell and enable tab cycle list
* The recent tells list is always added to the cycle list at the end after any partial tab completion matches
* To simplify the logic, tab completion will not work in a tell window if there is more than one open.
  - The tab cycles between the tell windows. The main chat window still has tab completion.
* Added support for tab completion of /commands. Works like bash with first tab filling out
  common prefix and second tabs supporting cycling through match list.

New /protect command:
* Provides secondary protection against accidental item loss by blocking destroying or dropping
  items if a non-empty container, value is above a threshold, or the item is on a protection list.
* Also provides protection from selling items on the block list (but no value check for selling)
  - See readme for usage notes

General:
* Add /selfclickthru command and option ('u' to open doors works in 3rd person)
* Added a zeal general tab option to enable container locking
  (context menu popup will allow toggling "Lock")
* Added an optional quiet parameter (/useitem # quiet) that
  will suppress warnings if the slot doesn't have a click effect
  (empty slot or no valid click). Still complains if invalid
  command (slot #) or blocked due to casting.
* Clicking on the skills window name or value columns will now
  toggle ascending or descending order
* Add option to export inventory and spellbook on /camp

### Bug fixes and infrastructure:
* Added simple heap checks at zeal construction (boot) that will generate a modal
  dialog box if any corruption detected
* Added showspelleffects state to the reasonsfile
* Added a /zeal get_command utility that will retrieve the command info struct
  including callback function address
* Refactored BitmapFont int a virtual base class to support both a 2D transformed vertex
  class and a 3D class that supports the z-buffer with occlusion and range
* Migrate some of the eqgame.dll features into Zeal
  - Buff timers, extended nameplates, brown skeletons, auto-stand, combat music
* RightClickToEquip now directly calls InvSlot functions rather than InvSlotWnd x/y clicks
