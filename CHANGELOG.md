# Changelog

Summarizes notable changes to Zeal

## [0.6.4 (BETA)] - 2025/01/21

### New features:
Nameplates
* Add custom font supports to the nameplates
  - Controlled through nameplate options tab or /nameplate zealfont to toggle
  - Can use any zeal installed fonts (added more fonts with reasonable sizes)
  - Added drop shadow support, bottom align for centered text
* Enabled the target auto-attack blinking indicator. Synchronized
  it with the targetring and uses the targetring options slider for rate.
* Added option to show pet owner names as second line to nameplate ("Pet" for self-pet)

Targetring:
* Add target_color option that uses targer color instead of con color

Map:
* Added a small dull yellow position marker for self-pet if
  show group members is enabled
* Added a new options checkbox that enables text with your
  current location in the upper left corner

General:
* Added a zeal general tab option to enable container locking
  (context menu popup will allow toggling "Lock")
* Added an optional quiet parameter (/useitem # quiet) that
  will suppress warnings if the slot doesn't have a click effect
  (empty slot or no valid click). Still complains if invalid
  command (slot #) or blocked due to casting.
* Clicking on the skills window name or value columns will now
  toggle ascending or descending order
* Added support for tab completion of /commands. Works like
  bash with first tab filling out common prefix and second
  tabs supporting cycling through match list.

### Bug fixes and infrastructure:
* Added simple heap checks at zeal construction (boot) that
  will generate a modal dialog box if any corruption detected
* Added showspelleffects state to the reasonsfile
* Added a /zeal get_command utility that will retrieve the
  command info struct including callback function address
* Refactored BitmapFont int a virtual base class to support both a 2D transformed vertex
  class and a 3D class that supports the z-buffer with occlusion and range
